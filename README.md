# iu_spotify

## Purpose of repo
While taking a data visualization class at the University of Michigan, I was tasked with exploring a data set and exhibiting knowledge of basic and advanced graphs. I had seen posts where people studied different discographies using the Spotify API (BTS specifically), and I wanted to jump into that data and see how the API worked. These notebooks don't show any outstanding discoveries about the artist IU's music but instead were practice for me at referencing unfamiliar libraries through documentation and Medium articles.

## Introduction on notebooks
I, like many others, have joined the Korean wave in the past few years due to the country's entertainment industry. As I've become a fan of the country and its different celebrities, I've wondered what qualities make up Korean entertainment. Specifically, I am curious about the country's musical attributes, as KPOP has uniquely developed an influence across the world. The Spotify API provides data on a song's popularity and a number of different musical attributes, including energy, danceability, and tempo. Using this data, I will dive into the trends of the singer IU's songs with the assistance of bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms.

For background, IU is a Korean artist who recently won the Artist and Album of the Year honors at Kakao's Melon Music Awards over other popular groups like BTS, NCT Dream, SHINee, and aespa (source). She has a lower global presence compared to BTS, Blackpink, and Girls Generation but is extremely popular within Korea and gives a strong representation of what Korean music is.

The purpose of this exploration of her music is to understand what attributes contribute to IU's most popular songs, how IU's music has changed or stayed the same over time, and how her music compares to popular songs in Korea and around the world. Afterwards, we may have greater insight into the type of music IU will release in upcoming years and how successful those songs will be.
